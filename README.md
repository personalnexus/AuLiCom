# AuLiCom â€” Aula Light Commander

Aula Light Commander connects to a serial port to control [DMX512](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMX512) devices for example via a USB-DMX adapter with the FTDI chip.

AuLiCom is made up of the following component parts.

## AuLiComLib

AuLiComLib encapsulates the logic of DMX communication, managing fixtures, scenes etc. independent of any kind of user interface.

## AuLiComCli

AuLiComCli exposes a minimal command-line interface using the [command syntax documented in the User Manual](doc/Manual.md).

## AuLiComGui

AuLiComGui is a planned graphical user-interface on top of AuLiComLib, but which as of July 2023 has not been started yet.

## AuLiComSim

AuLiComSim is a library containing an implementation of `IConnection` that shows a minimal graphical user-interface (based on WPF) with the values received from AuLiComCli to allow testing without actual DMX hardware.

## AuLiComXL

AuLiComXL is an Excel plugin to manage channel values, colors, fixtures, scenes and chasers. The plugin exposes formulas to be used in a spreadsheet as well as a COM server to be used from VBA.

The following screenshots from [this Excel spreadsheet](/doc/Excel/TestWithComServer.xlsm) show what AuLiComXL can do. As of August 2023, this is the most complete interface to AuLiCom's functionality. It starts with separate pages to define fixtures, colors and scenes.

Scenes can be played individually or used to build chasers.

Finally, it is possible to control each channel individually and highly interactively, either with an Excel formula or via the [command syntax](doc/Manual.md) in the cell in top left.
